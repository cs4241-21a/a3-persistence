Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The goal of the application is to provide a simple app where users can track tasks that need to be completed in the near future with important information such as how long the tasks are expected to take. Unfortunately, as the app is not finished, much functionality is missing.

The main challenge in realizing the application was time management. I failed to start the project early, and due to the deadline extensions I did not begin to cram in progress at the end until I was being ovelroaded with work for my other classes as well, leaving me not enough time to complete the requirements for the project.

No authentication strategy has been implemented, as there was not enough time. The Tailwind CSS framework was chosen as it seemed an ideal pick for a simple app to help manage work, though there was not enough time to leverage the framework to do much of anything for the UI. The only express middleware used is the required express static which is used to create the server and handle requests to the server from the client.
