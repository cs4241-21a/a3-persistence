===

Due: September 27th, by 11:59 AM.

This assignnment continues where we left off, extending it to use the most popular Node.js server framework (express), 
a database (mongodb), and a CSS application framework / template of your choice (Boostrap, Material Design, Semantic UI, Pure etc.)

## The To-Do List Site

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

My application's goal is to provide a virtual to-do list where someone can add and delete items from their list of things they need to do. This application was really hard for me, and while it isnt the best I can do, I worked very hard. I tried to just pick the easist stratagies. I kept the CSS framework simple by keeping the ont the same and changing the color scheme an a few other things. The other design and technical aspects of the project are very simple.
