Shannen Lin: 

- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. 

The goal of the application was to create a two-tier web application with a database, an express server, and a CSS framework. A user should be able to login to a page or create an account if they don't have one. Once logged in, a user can create, remove, and edit book reviews which will show up in a table.

I faced a lot of challenges to realize the application. The challenge that gave me the hardest time was to figure out how to have a user view only their own data and how I would communicate that between the different pages. I also had a hard time figuring out how to design my website to look nice as I don't really have much designing experience. Even with Bootstrap, I still struggled to figure out a good design.

I used server-side authentication with cookies simply because it seemed the easiest and the professor had already provided some sample code to work with.

For my various HTML input elements, I used text area, text field, password, and number inputs in my forms.

I used the Bootstrap CSS framework because it is very easy to use Bootstraps predefined design templates. It really helped with keeping my designs consistent across different browsers. I made a few changes to the CSS. For example, Bootstrap only has 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% for setting the width but I wanted a value of 30%. Also, the way that Bootstrap handled tables was not really to my liking so I added my own CSS code for that.

The 5 Express middleware packages I used were: `body-parser` which parses the incoming request bodies before the handlers and puts them inside request.body, `cookie-session` which stores the session data on the client within a cookie and was useful for authentication, 
`serve-static`
`serve-favicon`
`helmet`
