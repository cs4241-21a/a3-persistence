Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template
===

This assignment currently supports the following features:
- a `Server`, created using Express (no alternatives will be accepted for this assignment)
- The following Express middleware packages:
    - Body-parser
    
- Persistent data storage in between server sessions using [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Use of a [CSS framework or template](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks). 
This should do the bulk of your styling/CSS for you and be appropriate to your application. 
For example, don't use [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) (which is awesome!) unless you're creating a game or some type of retro 80s site.

The HTML components contain the following:
- Fields to input a username and password on a login page
- Fields to input new data on the main page


JavaScript:  
- None that works as of this iteration

Node.js:  
- A server using Express, the body-parser Express middleware, and a persistent database (mongodb).
