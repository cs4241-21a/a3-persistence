## Grade App

http://a3-markjforte2000.glitch.me/
  
The goal of this application was to record students graduation year and class title.
Several challenges were overcome during this project such as learning how to use express and how to
connect to a database. I chose to use the simple cookie based authentication shown in the example as it was simple
to implement. I used the bootstrap framework as it was easy and gave the project a better look. 
The five middleware packages I used:
serve-favicon: Give a favicon to the website
timeout: to timeout any long connections
response-time: to record the response time of the api
cookie-session: to handle authentication
body-parser: to handle parsing form data
static: to serve static files



## Technical Achievements
