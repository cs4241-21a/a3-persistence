# Challenges

- I ran into an issue last minute with MongoDB where I could not get it to work. I am pretty sure my connection string should be correct, but my collection would not populate, any ideas? I would be very happy to find out what I was doing wrong.
- I wanted to get MongoDB running to ensure my Modify and Delete were working as intended, but could not troubleshoot that due to my MongoDB issues.
