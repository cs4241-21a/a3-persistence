- authentication strategy: Mongo DB, because other strategies are not been taught, and I am not sure I can achieve them

  - I put some photos and make some changes to the table in the website
- 5 Express middleware packages
  - cookie-session: check whether successfully log in
  - express-session: I tried both this and cookie to see whether there are any differences between them. I thought cookie is better       so I only keep cookie.
