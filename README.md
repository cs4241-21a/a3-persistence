The web app stores and manages a list of locations to travel to based on the user log on. 
The main challenges I faced working on this app was utilizing the database and how to structure it with the different collections. 
I ended up having a collection to store usernames and password, then a collection for each specific user was created when an account was created.
I was also confused on how to go back to the login page (index.html) but display a error so I just created a new page with an error displayed.
Accounts are created if the username currently is not in the database when loginning. If the username is in the database, then the password 
must match the one in the database.
For the CSS framework, I decided to use Bootstrap because it was the most popular framework.
The 5 middleware I used are morgan, body-parser, cookie-session, serve-favicon, and serve-static.
