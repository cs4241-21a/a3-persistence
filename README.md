Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- To allow users to rate their books and have them ranked according to their ratings.
- I had challenges getting the database to connect.
- I used cookies and a hashmap in the server to store the usernames and associated passwords since my database was not working. (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- Normalize.css since it seemed nice and modern.
  - All custom CSS is in style.css
- 1. urlencoded: I used this to get the encoded data.
- 2. cookieSession: I used this to handle cookies dealing with users.
- 3. bodyparser: I used this to parse the body of my json.
- 4. listen: I used this to listen for the port.
- 5. custom "app.post( '/submit-book'": I used this to add a new book or edit an exisiting book. It also sorts the books by their rating and adds rankings to them based on this sorting.
